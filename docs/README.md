## Features <a name="Features"></a>

Duke's intelligent parser allows user to type in command in a natural language 
and supports abbreviations to avoid less typing. Duke is also able to save the tasks and
automatically load them back the next time it starts.

### Natural syntax <a name="Natural-syntax"></a>

Duke allows user to key in semi-structured input. For example, `deadline test by 1900 17/01/2021` and
`add deadline test by 17/1/2021 1900`, or `mark 5` and `done 5` infer the same instructions respectively.
Duke also understands various time formats automatically. For eample `1900 17/1/2021`, `17/01/2021 1900` 
and `1900 17/1` all means the same time.

### Abbreviation <a name="Abbreviation"></a>

Duke supports abbreviations, which allows user to perform operations faster and save time. For example,
`add` and `a`, or `delete` and `del` can be used interchangably.

### Auto-loading <a name="Auto-loading"></a>

Duke is able to save the task list using the `save` command and automatically load them back the next time 
Duke starts.


## Getting Started <a name="Getting-Started"></a>

Start Duke by running 
```
java -jar dir/to/duke.jar
``` 
Duke create a `tmp/` folder under your current directory for its storage. If `tmp/` already exist, 
it will look for `storage.txt` for saved tasks and automatically load them back. 

After Duke is ran successfully, you should see a command prompt where you can key in your commands.
You may add a todo by 
```
add todo hello
``` 

Now lets create another task, `deadline`. Run 
```
add deadline exam by 1800 1/10/2021
```
This will create a deadline with time. Note that the leading `add` can be omitted and the parser will automatically infer it. 

You may run `list` to check if these tasks are created successfully. It should show something like the following,

```
1. [T] [_] hello
2. [D] [_] exam @ 2021-10-01 18:00
```

The first bracket tells the type of the task. The second bracket tells if a task has been marked. 

To mark task 2, run 
```
mark 2
``` 
To delete task 1, run 
```
delete 1
``` 
Run `list` again. You should see task 1 has been deleted and task 2 has been marked.
```
1. [D] [X] exam @ 2021-10-01 18:00
```
Alternatively, you can also find this task by `find exam`. 

If you are unsure about some commands, type `help` to see available commands. Now you are ready to go!
